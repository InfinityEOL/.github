## 📦 About

Welcome to **infinityeol** the official archive of deprecated, retired, or legacy repositories from the [Infinity List](https://github.com/InfinityBotList) ecosystem.

This org exists to preserve the history of our tooling, experiments, and services that are no longer in active development but may still be useful for:

- ✍️ Reference
- 🛠️ Migration history
- 🧪 Learning from the past
- ⚰️ Laughing at cursed old code

## 📝 Policy

These repositories are:
- ❄️ **Frozen** — no active maintenance
- 💡 **Informational** — for learning or documentation
- 🔒 **Preserved as-is** — security issues will not be patched

> [!CAUTION]
> ⚠️ These repositories are **not production ready**, likely out of date, and frozen in time. Use them for reference only **you break it, you bought it.** Infinity List makes no guarantees about the usability, stability, or sanity of the code archived here. Use at your own risk and don’t force push to main. Ever.
